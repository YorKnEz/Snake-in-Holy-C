# About snake-games

This repo contains snake games made in the different esoteric languages that I'm learning.

## Holy C

This is a snake game made in the Holy C programming language, on Temple OS.

Unfortunately, there is no way currently to compile this code on any other OS than Temple OS, so you would have to handcopy this code to a Temple OS instance and run it.
